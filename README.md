# Task 8: Stored Procedures and Functions

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Learn reusable SQL blocks using **Stored Procedures** and **Functions**.

## ðŸ›  Tools
- DB Browser for SQLite (for structure)
- MySQL Workbench (for execution of stored procedures and functions)

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- `task8_procedures_functions.sql`: Includes table creation, stored procedure, function, and usage examples.
- `README.md`: This file.

## ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s Covered?
1. âœ… **Stored Procedure** `GetEmployeesByDepartment` with input parameter and SELECT logic.
